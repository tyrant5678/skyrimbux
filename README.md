# skyrimbux
This is skyrimbux, a neat little program that takes a person's net worth and the name of a Skyrim item, then converts that net worth into said Skyrim item. Everything you want to download is housed in the dist zip on this repo.

--this whole bit has been copied and pasted from the README in the dist folder

I know none of you will actually read this so I can basically say what I want. Haha you stupid dumb dumb. Bet you
don't even know how to read ahahaha you fool. I have power over you and all that you love. skyrimbux is my
creation, and she shall not be disrespected. Therefore, I reserve the right to sue you for slander should you
ever disrespect this beautiful program that was created over the course of about a week.

After days spent languishing in the darkness of the C:\Users\Student\Desktop\Skyrimbux folder,
desperate for the light, she emerges, shining and shimmering into the great world beyond, eager to see all which
is in store for her. To protect my child and ensure that I have a firm control over the sheep of the world when
this program eventually makes me your immortal overlord, I DEMAND that you follow these simple rules when using
skyrimbux.exe:

1) Please for the love of god don't crash this program. This code is held together about as well that stupid pig's
straw house from the Three Little Pigs. Yeah, we all know what happened to him, and I don't want that to happen
to me. Please, Jeff Bezos is breathing down my neck and if this fails even once then I'm gonna... Shit he's right
behind me. *sobbing, shaking* Please, save me, end user. You are the only one who can save me from Bezos's
dungeon...
2) Respect me. My word is law and those that would break it are subject to the death penalty.
3) My word is Jeff's word. Disregard my word, you disregard Amazon. He WILL cancel your Prime(TM) membership
like that. *snaps*
4) Do NOT convert Jeff's net worth. We all know I'm collecting every single bit of info that you put in here,
so just know that if anyone decides to put in Jeff here, I will be forced to report you to him directly, and
you run the risk of being executed by firing sqaud in Bolivia.
5) Have fun!

SIDE NOTE: NONE OF THIS IS A SERIOUS PROGRAM AND SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS SUCH. GRANTED, IT DOES DO WHAT IT
IS MEANT TO DO BUT NONE OF THE CONTENT WITHIN THE PROGRAM (BESIDES THE NUMBERS) OR THIS README SHOULD BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY. UNLESS YOU'RE MEAN, THEN GO RIGHT AHEAD. I'LL CRY QUIETLY IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM WHILE I READ YOUR
ANGRY COMMENTS. DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL FACE NO NEGATIVE REPURCUSSIONS.
